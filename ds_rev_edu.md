# But:

* What is data science?
* What should we teach?
* What is it going to look like?

# Data science in Berkeley

* February 2013: [Supporting Data Science
  Workshop](https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/supporting-data-science-campus-wide-workshop-0)
* 2013: [Berkeley Institute of Data Science](https://bids.berkeley.edu/about)
* 2015: [Foundations of data science course](http://data8.org)
* 2018: [National workshop on data science
  education](https://data.berkeley.edu/undergraduate-ds-pedagogy)
* 2018: [Division of data science:
  announced](https://news.berkeley.edu/2018/11/01/berkeley-inaugurates-division-of-data-science-and-information-connecting-teaching-and-research-from-all-corners-of-campus)

# Berkeley teaching programme

* Massive (~1500 student) course [Foundations of data
  science](https://data.berkeley.edu/education/courses/data-8) - "Data 8".  No
  requirements in mathematics or programming.  Running since 2015.
* Large (~900 student) intermediate course [Principles and techniques of data
  science](http://www.ds100.org) with further requirements in Python programming and linear algebra.
* [27 Connector courses](https://data.berkeley.edu/education/connectors):
  domain applications of teaching methods from the foundation course.
* "... embracing a reinvention of statistical education in the era of
  pervasive computation." [Report by Data science education rapid reaction
  team](https://data.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/datasciencecurriculumsketch.pdf)
* The greatest change in undergraduate teaching in a generation.

# Data 8 elements

*   **No Prerequisites** - There are no prerequisites besides the high school
    math that it took you to get to UC:
    *   No Math or Programming Background Required
*   **Easy to Access** - There is an easy-to-use computing platform that is
    integrated into every aspect of the course and works on any browser with
    no technical requirements
    *   No specific computer, software license, install needed
*   **Coding and Statistics** - There are advantages to learning coding at the
    same time as learning statistics  - *Computational Thinking, Inferential
    Thinking*
*   **Visualize First** - represent the data graphically in order to motivate
    questions about inference and concepts of statistics
*   **Minimize Formulas** - Don’t show or depend on formulas, delay formulas
    until the concept is explained, intuition and interpretation are more
    important
*   **Re-Sampling** - guide students towards non-parametric approaches by
    motivating resampling for hypothesis testing

# Principles of the course

* Teaching statistics "assuming computers exist, rather than assuming they
  don't exist."
* "Express in code what we would otherwise express in equations."

# Undergraduate data science at the University of Birmingham

* 2017: Bioscience second year undergraduates; Introduction to R programming language.
* 2018: ["Data science for everyone" WHM](https://matthew-brett.github.io/dsfe2019)
* 2018: Geography first year undergraduates; Introduction to R.
* 2019: [Introduction to programming](https://matthew-brett.github.io/cfd2019)
  second-year undergraduate / MSc module (10 UK credits, run over one term).
* Plans to extend this approach across modules and schools.

# What do we need?

* debate
* vision
* mechanism

# What can we do?

* CPD to explain pedagogy.
* Harness commitment from faculty and students.
